# Preface {-}

The analysis of normal and non-normal data are mostly based on the class
of generalized linear models [@nelder1972]. The class offers a very
attractive statistical modelling framework which includes the Gaussian,
logistic and Poisson regression models for the analysis of continuous,
binomial and count data, respectively. The theoretical background for
the GLM is based on the exponential dispersion models
[@jorgensen1987; @jorgensen1997] as a generalization of the exponential
family of distributions. Furthermore, the whole class of models can be
fitted by a simple Newton score algorithm relying only on second-moment
assumptions for estimation and inference.  Despite of the flexibility of
the GLM class, the Poisson distribution is the only choice for analysis
of count data. For this reason, in practice there is probably an
over-emphasis on the use of the Poisson distribution. A well known
limitation of the Poisson distribution is the mean and variance
relationship, referred to as equidispersion. In practice, however, count
data can present other features, namely underdispersion and
overdispersion that is often related to zero-inflation, heavy tail or
absence of important explanatory variables. These features can make the
Poisson distribution unsuitable for the analysis of count data.  The
main goal of this course is to present a wider range of statistical
models to deal with count data. In particular, we focus on parametric
and second-moments specified models. We shall present the model
specification along with strategies for model fitting and the associated
R code. Furthermore, a book-course and supplementary material as R
[rcore2016] code and data sets will be made available for the students.
We intend to keep the course in a level suitable for bachelor students
who already attended a course on generalized linear models. However,
since the course also covers updated topics, it can be of interest of
postgraduate students and researches in general. In what follows, we
describe the course structure as well as the main bibliography
references on which the course is based. The subject covered and the
Expected learning outcome.
