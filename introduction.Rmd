# Introduction #

Figure \@ref(fig:process-ilustration) illustrates the generator process
for under, over and equidispered counts in two dimensions context. The
grid lines in this figure indicate fixed regions for which events are
counted and the counts within each interval are displayed. For the
equidispersed case the distribution of events is random. In
overdispersed case, the events are clustered. This behaviour can be
explained by a contamination process (e.g. count contagious
disease). The underdispersed case, in contrast of overdispersion, shows
the events distribution is nearly regular and the counts have smaller
variances. The natural process that explains underdispersion is
repulsion, exactly the opposite of overdispersion, that means, an
event occurence inhibits others near (e.g. count territorialistas
animals).
